## Dine in world class restaurants

For free! That’s right, it’s a secret that nobody tells you when you’re booking your ticket. You can eat for free in Las Vegas by following these three steps:

- If you’re hungry, wait until a restaurant worker is taking out the garbage
- Follow them outside to the alley
- When they toss the garbage in the dumpster, that’s your chance.

Grab it while its hot. **Seriously**, you don’t want to wait until it gets cold.

## Go to the zoo

According to Animal Planet Magazine, the average human sees three hundred thousand animals during his or her lifetime.

> It’s quite a lot. We’re aware of that. Of course, nobody knows the _exact_ number. It’s really just an estimate. But I know a guy who likes to go on those safari adventures and he told me. I trust him.

There are six reasons why I’d trust the numbers:

1. The guy goes on safaris so he’s obviously an animal lover
2. Why would he lie?
3. Do you have any scientific evidence to prove otherwise?
4. Any peer related journal articles I could look at?
5. Well? Do you have any?
6. It’s on Wikipedia just look it up.

Here’s [the article][1] if you’re interested.

And here’s the doctor himself in an interview talking about it.

## Go on Twitter

You probably haven’t been on your phone since the airport. Well, you better fix that.

Studies show that going on Twitter when you’re on vacation is a great way to pass the time.

You can almost _feel_ the tweets coming at you.
